                Different articles have varieties of definition about Artificial Intelligent 
                but for this document we have selected the following two definitions to give 
                readers general idea.  Techopedia.com defines Artificial intelligence (AI) is 
                an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines 
                that work and react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial 
                intelligence are designed for include:
            </p> 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Speech recognition

                <li>
                    Learning Planning

                <li>
                    Problem solving
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of computer program or a machine to 
            think and learn. It is also a field of study which tries to make computers "smart". 
            They work on their own without being encoded with commands.

            </h5>
            <p>
                The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956, but AI has become more 
                popular today thanks to increased data volumes, advanced algorithms, and 
                improvements in computing power and storage.
                <br> 
                Early AI research in the 1950s explored topics like problem solving and symbolic 
                methods. In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense took interest in this type of 
                work and began training computers to mimic basic human reasoning. For example, the 
                Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) completed street mapping projects 
                in the 1970s. And DARPA produced intelligent personal assistants in 2003, long before 
                Siri, Alexa or Cortana were household names.
                <br>
                This early work paved the way for the automation and formal reasoning that we see in 
                computers today, including decision support systems and smart search systems that can 
                be designed to complement and augment human abilities. 
                <br>
                The research about Artificial Intelligence was started long time ago even before 1950’s. 
                However, the term AI is introduced in 1950’s. The following list of events are presented 
                to show how  the evolution of AI is happened.

                Now days every industry has a high demand for AI capabilities. AI is helping human being in 
                almost every part of our lives. To mention some of uses includes:

                </h4>
                <p>
                    AI applications can provide personalized medicine and X-ray     readings. Personal health care 
                    assistants can act as life coaches, reminding you to take your  pills, exercise or eat healthier. 
                </p>

                    AI provides virtual shopping capabilities that offer personalized   recommendations and discuss purchase 
                    options with the consumer. Stock management and site layout     technologies will also be improved with AI.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Manufacturing

                    Artificial Intelligence enhances the speed, precision and   effectiveness of human efforts. In financial 
                    institutions, AI techniques can be used to identify which   transactions are likely to be fraudulent, 
                    adopt fast and accurate credit scoring, as well as automate manually    intense data management tasks.
